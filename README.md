# mad-minute-math
A fun math game for elementary school children. This application will give students an opportunity to complete as many math problems as they can in 1 minute. A student can choose between 3 difficulity levels (easy level, intermediate level, and hard level) and different classes of problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The student will be able to track how many answers they got correct and how many questions they got incorrect. This application was created using Python and Kivy.
